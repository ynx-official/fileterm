## What Is FileTerm?

FileTerm is built for daily remote work by developers and operations teams. It brings remote terminals, file management, transfer tasks, and connection profiles into one desktop workspace.

- SSH sessions pair terminal work naturally with SFTP file panels.
- FTP/FTPS sessions use a focused file-only workflow.
- Multiple connections run side by side in tabs without interrupting each other.
- Uploads, downloads, progress, and errors are managed in one transfer center.
- Connection profiles, workspace state, and themes are designed for long-term daily use.

The official release focuses on the most frequent `SSH / SFTP / FTP / FTPS` workflows: reliable remote terminals, file operations, and transfers.

## Core Capabilities

| Capability                  | Description                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SSH profile management      | Create, edit, delete, and group SSH profiles with JSON persistence.                                                          |
| FTP/FTPS profile management | Uses a connection model kept separate from SSH and supports secure FTP transfers.                                            |
| SSH terminal                | Powered by xterm.js with input/output, resize, search, clipboard support, and a floating command bar.                        |
| SFTP file management        | Browse remote directories; read, write, create, delete, rename, and change permissions.                                      |
| FTP/FTPS file management    | FTP/FTPS sessions with remote browsing, file operations, and resumable transfers.                                            |
| File editor                 | A Monaco Editor-based two-pane file tree and editor with syntax highlighting, find/replace, encoding, and language controls. |
| Terminal directory sync     | Keeps the active SSH working directory and file manager in sync.                                                             |
| Root privilege sync         | Detects `sudo` / `su` in the terminal and synchronizes the file-manager permission context.                                  |
| Virtualized file list       | Uses virtual scrolling for efficient browsing of large remote directories.                                                   |
| Transfer center             | Centralized uploads, downloads, resume support, progress, speed, cancellation, and recursive folder transfers.               |
| Workspace tabs              | Parallel connections, disconnect/reconnect, persisted state, and animated tab transitions.                                   |
| Command templates           | Grouped quick commands, parameter placeholders, and one-click sending.                                                       |
| Theme system                | Dark and light themes through tokens, CSS variables, and component skins.                                                    |
| Remote status monitoring    | Connection status and system-resource summaries.                                                                             |
| Theme and desktop shell     | Dark and light themes, sidebars, file drawer, focus mode, and dedicated management windows.                                  |

## Technology Stack

| Desktop  | Renderer     | Language          | Terminal | Editor        | Protocols                             | Tooling                |
| -------- | ------------ | ----------------- | -------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Tauri v2 | React + Vite | Rust + TypeScript | xterm.js | Monaco Editor | russh/russh-sftp + suppaftp + tokio-* | Cargo + npm workspaces |

```txt
renderer UI    -> React workspace, tabs, files, terminal
Tauri bridge   -> typed Rust command/event boundary
Rust services  -> session lifecycle, storage, update and protocol services
protocols      -> russh SSH/SFTP, FTP/FTPS, Telnet and Serial adapters
theme system   -> tokens -> vars -> skins -> terminal colors
```

## Architecture Principles

```txt
Renderer UI
  -> Application State
    -> Tauri API bridge
      -> Rust commands/events
        -> Desktop services
          -> Session workers
            -> Protocol clients
```

- `packages/core` is the single source of truth for domain models.
- The renderer never accesses SSH, SFTP, or FTP/FTPS protocol clients directly.
- All system capabilities are exposed through `Rust commands/events -> tauri-api.ts -> renderer`.
- SSH/SFTP and FTP/FTPS remain separate at controller and protocol layers.
- Transfer progress enters one transfer system instead of being maintained separately by components.

See [docs/architecture.md](./docs/architecture.md) for the complete architecture map.

## Getting Started from Source

### Requirements

- Node.js >= 22.12.0
- npm

### Install and Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Common Commands

```bash
npm run dev
npm run test
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm run release:mac
npm run release:win
```

### Releases and Updates

- A `vX.Y.Z` tag on a `release/*` commit runs the Tauri-only Release Action and publishes macOS arm64/x64 DMGs plus the Windows x64 NSIS installer.
- The Windows job also publishes the signed NSIS installer, its `.sig` signature, and `latest.json`; installed Windows clients verify that manifest before updating.
- Configure the repository Actions Secret `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` with the Tauri updater private-key contents. Never commit that private key.
- macOS release bundles use ad-hoc signing (without an Apple Developer certificate or notarization) and deliberately keep the GitHub Release download flow rather than using the in-app updater. First-run users may still need to whitelist the app in Privacy & Security.

```

## Roadmap

Post-release priorities:

1. Keep improving the stability and usability of the `SSH / SFTP / FTP / FTPS` core workflows.
2. Keep refining the Tauri workspace, session service, and renderer boundaries.
3. Continue consolidating domain types in `packages/core`.
4. Improve transfer tasks, errors, themes, terminal input, file drawers, and the desktop shell.
5. Maintain release quality and distribution for macOS and Windows.

See [docs/roadmap.md](./docs/roadmap.md) for the full plan.

## Open Source Components

- [xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org/) for SSH terminal rendering, input/output, and resize handling.
- [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) for file editing, syntax highlighting, and search/replace.

## Contributing

This repository treats the codebase as its record system:

- [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) is the entry map for collaboration.
- [docs/architecture.md](./docs/architecture.md) records stable architecture facts.
- [docs/plans/active](./docs/plans/active) contains active cross-layer plans.
- [docs/decisions](./docs/decisions) records confirmed architecture decisions.
- [.agents/extensions](./.agents/extensions) contains feature drafts and extension designs.

For a substantial feature, please add or update an active plan before writing code.
